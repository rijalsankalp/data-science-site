<h1>Getting Set Up</h1>
<p>Open <code>RStudio</code> and create a new RMarkDown file (<code>.Rmd</code>) by going to <code>File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown...</code>.
Accept defaults and save this file as <code>[LAST NAME]_ps3.Rmd</code> to your <code>code</code> folder.</p>
<p>Copy and paste the contents of this <code>.Rmd</code> file into your <code>[LAST NAME]_ps3.Rmd</code> file. Then change the <code>author: [Your Name]</code> to your name.</p>
<p>All of the following questions should be answered in this <code>.Rmd</code> file. There are code chunks with incomplete code that need to be filled in. To submit, compile (i.e., <code>knit as pdf</code>) the completed problem set and upload the PDF file to Blackboard on Friday by midnight. Be sure to check your knitted PDF for mistakes before submitting!</p>
<p>This problem set is worth 18 total points, plus 1 extra credit point (and an additional extra credit point for the winner; more below). The point values for each question are indicated in brackets below. To receive full credit, you must have the correct code. In addition, some questions ask you to provide a written response in addition to the code.</p>
<p>You will be deducted 1 point for each day late the problem set is submitted, and 1 point for failing to submit in the correct format (i.e., not knitting as a PDF).</p>
<p>You are free to rely on whatever resources you need to complete this problem set, including lecture notes, lecture presentations, Google, your classmates…you name it. However, the final submission must be complete by you. There are no group assignments.</p>
<p><em>Note that the professor will not respond to Campuswire posts after 2PM on Friday, so don’t wait until the last minute to get started!</em></p>
<p><strong>Good luck!</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you collaborated with a colleague and/or used AI for any help on this problem set, document here.</strong> Write the names of your classmates and/or upload a PDF of your AI prompt and output with your problem set:</p>

<h2>Question 1 [2 points]</h2>
<p>In this problem set, we are interested in developing a classifier that maximizes our accuracy for predicting Fortnite victories. To do so we will use both a linear probability model and a logit, and then compare their predictive accuracy. We will use two <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> variables to predict the probability of winning: accuracy (<code>accuracy</code>), and head shots (<code>head_shots</code>). Our outcome variable of interest <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is whether the player won the game (<code>won</code>).</p>
<p>Start by <strong>looking</strong> at these variables. Why types of variables are they? How much missingness do they have? What do their univariate visualizations look like? Then create two multivariate visualizations of the relationship between <code>won</code> and each of the two <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> variables one-by-one. Finally, use <code>geom_tile()</code> to create a heatmap of the three-way relationship, where quintiles of <code>accuracy</code> is on the x-axis, quintiles of <code>head_shots</code> is on the y-axis, and tiles are filled according to the average winning probability. (NB: look up what “quintile” means if you are not sure.) Is there anything surprising about this result?</p>

<h2>Question 2 [2 points]</h2>
<p>Now let’s run a linear model and evaluate it in terms of overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity using a threshold of 0.5. Then, determine the threshold that maximizes both specificity and sensitivity. Finally, calculate the area under the curve (AUC).</p>

<h2>Question 5 [2 points]</h2>
<p>Let’s consider two possible <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> variables which might help us predict whether a player wins a Fortnite match: <code>revives</code> and <code>eliminations</code>. <code>revives</code> counts the total number of times a player is brought back to life by a teammate. <code>eliminations</code> is a measure of how many times the player killed an opponent.
