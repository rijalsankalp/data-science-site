<h2>Getting Set Up</h2>
<p>Open <code>RStudio</code> and create a new RMarkDown file (<code>.Rmd</code>) by going to <code>File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown...</code>.
Accept defaults and save this file as <code>[LAST NAME]_ps2.Rmd</code> to your <code>code</code> folder.</p>
<p>Copy and paste the contents of this <code>.Rmd</code> file into your <code>[LAST NAME]_ps2.Rmd</code> file. Then change the <code>author: [Your Name]</code> to your name.</p>
<p>All of the following questions should be answered in this <code>.Rmd</code> file. There are code chunks with incomplete code that need to be filled in. To submit, compile (i.e., <code>knit as pdf</code>) the completed problem set and upload the PDF file to Blackboard on Friday by midnight. Be sure to check your knitted PDF for mistakes before submitting!</p>
<p>This problem set is worth 27 total points, plus 3.5 extra credit points. The point values for each question are indicated in brackets below. To receive full credit, you must have the correct code. In addition, some questions ask you to provide a written response in addition to the code.</p>
<p>You will be deducted 1 point for each day late the problem set is submitted, and 1 point for failing to submit in the correct format (i.e., not knitting as a PDF).</p>
<p>You are free to rely on whatever resources you need to complete this problem set, including lecture notes, lecture presentations, Google, your classmates…you name it. However, the final submission must be complete by you. There are no group assignments.</p>
<p><em>Note that the professor will not respond to Campuswire posts after 2PM on Friday, so don’t wait until the last minute to get started!</em></p>
<p><strong>Good luck!</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you collaborated with a colleague and/or used AI for any help on this problem set, document here.</strong> Write the names of your classmates and/or upload a PDF of your AI prompt and output with your problem set:</p>

<p>Now Scott is asking for a similar analysis of other teams. Calculate the difference between home and away points for every team in the league and prepare a summary table that includes both the average difference for each team, as well as your confidence about whether the difference is not zero. Based on these data, would you argue that there is an <strong>overall</strong> home court advantage in terms of points across the NBA writ large? Visualize these summary results by plotting the difference on the x-axis, the teams (reordered) on the y-axis, and the points colored by whether you are more than 90% confident in your answer. How should we interpret confidence levels less than 50%?</p>

<p><em>We are interested in how the YouTube recommendation algorithm works. These data are collected from real users, logged into their real YouTube accounts, allowing us to see who gets recommended which videos. We will investigate three research questions in this problem set:</em></p>
<p><em>1. What is the relationship between average ideology of recommendations shown to each user, and the average ideology of all the videos the user has watched?</em></p>
<p><em>2. What is the relationship between the average ideology of recommendations shown to each user, and the average ideology of the current video the user was watching when they were shown the recommendation?</em></p>
<p><em>3. Which of these relationships is stronger? Why?</em></p>
<p><em>Start by answering all three of these research questions, and explaining your thinking. Be very precise about your assumptions!</em></p>
